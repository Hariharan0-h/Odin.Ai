ðŸš€ Odin AI Training Roadmap

  Phase 1: Foundation (Current)

  - âœ… Basic transformer architecture
  - âœ… Character-level tokenization
  - âœ… Simple training loop

  Phase 2: Data & Scale

  Better Training Data

  - Text Sources: Books, articles, conversations, code
  - Data Preprocessing: Clean, normalize, deduplicate
  - Tokenization: Switch to subword (BPE/SentencePiece)
  - Data Size: 1M+ tokens vs current 5K

  Model Scaling

  - Parameters: 1M â†’ 10M â†’ 100M
  - Context Length: 32 â†’ 512 â†’ 2048 tokens
